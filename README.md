## 🌐 What is libp2p?

[libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) is a modular peer-to-peer networking stack that powers many of the largest decentralized networks in the world.  
It provides:
- Peer discovery
- Pubsub messaging
- Gossip protocols
- Transport abstractions (TCP, QUIC, WebRTC, etc.)
- NAT traversal
- Secure channel multiplexing

From Ethereum consensus to decentralized messaging protocols, libp2p is a backbone for Web3 and P2P applications.
