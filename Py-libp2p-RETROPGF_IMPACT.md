# üìå RetroPGF Impact Report: py-libp2p, py-cid, and py-multiformats

## üåê Overview

We maintain **py-libp2p, py-cid, and py-multiformats**, foundational Python libraries that bring the Filecoin/IPFS/libp2p ecosystem to the Python community.  

- **py-libp2p**: Python implementation of the libp2p networking stack  
- **py-cid**: Python implementation of Content Identifiers (CID)  
- **py-multiformats**: Python implementation of multiformats (multiaddr, multibase, multihash, etc.)  

These libraries enable Python developers ‚Äî especially researchers, data scientists, and AI/ML engineers ‚Äî to **learn, contribute, and build Web3 applications** in the Filecoin/IPFS ecosystem.

## üöÄ Impact Since November 2024

- Ensured alignment with **libp2p and IPLD specifications**  
- Fixed interoperability issues across implementations  
- Improved **stability and documentation** for production use  
- Supported multiple real-world projects and research efforts  
- Lowered the barrier for Python-first developers to engage with decentralized technologies

## üîß Projects Using py-libp2p enabling Digital Public Goods Eco-system

### 1. Federated Learning with Filecoin Storage
- Repo: [P2P-Federated-Learning](https://github.com/lla-dane/P2P-Federated-Learning)  
- **Description**: A framework where participants train ML models collaboratively without central servers.  
- **Role of py-libp2p**: Provides peer-to-peer communication layer; Filecoin used for model/data storage.  
- **Impact**: Demonstrates how libp2p enables decentralized AI/ML workflows in Python.  

---

### 2. Proof of Contribution
- Repo: [Proof-of-Contribution](https://github.com/seetadev/Proof-of-Contribution)  
- **Description**: A protocol to verify and measure contributions in decentralized systems.  
- **Role of py-libp2p**: Powers peer discovery and secure messaging.  
- **Impact**: Enables transparent reputation and accountability in DAOs and collaborative ecosystems.  

---

### 3. IPFS Toolkit in Python
- Repo: [ipfs_kit_py](https://github.com/endomorphosis/ipfs_kit_py/tree/main/ipfs_kit_py/libp2p)  
- **Description**: A Python toolkit that integrates IPFS and libp2p.  
- **Role of py-libp2p**: Core networking backbone.  
- **Impact**: Simplifies IPFS adoption for Python developers and data scientists.  

---

## üìä Ecosystem Impact

- **Python as an entry point**: Python is the dominant language in AI/ML and research. By maintaining these libraries, we bring new communities into the Filecoin/IPFS ecosystem.  
- **Bridging ecosystems**: Academic and research prototypes in Python can transition toward production decentralized applications.  
- **Interoperability & Education**: The libraries are both **learning tools** for decentralized networking concepts and **production-grade tools** for real deployments.  

---

## üîÆ Future Plans

- Expand tutorials and documentation for onboarding Python developers  
- Strengthen cross-language interoperability tests (Go, Rust, JS libp2p)  
- Highlight more production use cases across research and industry  
- Explore integration with Python-based AI/ML frameworks for decentralized model training and data sharing
